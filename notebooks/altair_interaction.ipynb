    "\n",
    "_“A graphic is not ‘drawn’ once and for all; it is ‘constructed’ and reconstructed until it reveals all the relationships constituted by the interplay of the data. The best graphic operations are those carried out by the decision-maker themself.”_ &mdash; [Jacques Bertin](https://books.google.com/books?id=csqX_xnm4tcC)\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization provides a powerful means of making sense of data. A single image, however, typically provides answers to, at best, a handful of questions. Through _interaction_ we can transform static images into tools for exploration: highlighting points of interest, zooming in to reveal finer-grained patterns, and linking across multiple views to reason about multi-dimensional relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of interaction is the notion of a _selection_: a means of indicating to the computer which elements or regions we are interested in. For example, we might hover the mouse over a point, click multiple marks, or draw a bounding box around a region to highlight subsets of the data for further scrutiny.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alongside visual encodings and data transformations, Altair provides a _selection_ abstraction for authoring interactions. These selections encompass three aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input event handling to select points or regions of interest, such as mouse hover, click, drag, scroll, and touch events.\n",
    "2. Generalizing from the input to form a selection rule (or [_predicate_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_%28mathematical_logic%29)) that determines whether or not a given data record lies within the selection.\n",
    "3. Using the selection predicate to dynamically configure a visualization by driving _conditional encodings_, _filter transforms_, or _scale domains_.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces interactive selections and explores how to use them to author a variety of interaction techniques, such as dynamic queries, panning &amp; zooming, details-on-demand, and brushing &amp; linking.\n",

    "Earlier we observed a small bump in the number of movies in either 1969 and 1970. Where does that bump come from? And why 1969 _or_ 1970? The answer stems from a combination of missing data and how your computer represents time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, dates and times are represented relative to the [UNIX epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), in which time \"zero\" corresponds to the stroke of midnight on January 1, 1970 in [UTC time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time), which runs along the [prime meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_meridian). It turns out there are a few movies with missing (`null`) release dates. Those `null` values get interpreted as time `0`, and thus map to January 1, 1970 in UTC time. If you live in the Americas &ndash; and thus in \"earlier\" time zones &ndash; this precise point in time corresponds to an earlier hour on December 31, 1969 in your local time zone. On the other hand, if you live near or east of the prime meridian, the date in your local time zone will be January 1, 1970.\n",
